For my Pizza restaurant we have a website that just shows the Menu. I want to be able to edit the menu, opening times and see contact requests in a
dashboard that I can get into with a private account.

1. Create dashboard with login.

I want a dashboard thats ONLY accesable when I logged in. I want to be able to login with the following credentials:

Username: Admin
Password: password

2. Make menu editable via the dashboard and save menu in database.

For the menu I want to keep the 3 categories and be able to add items by category (Pizza, Salads & Starter). I want to be able to define a title, description, price and
optional special condition (HOT, SEASONAL, POPULAR or NEW) for each menu item. These menu items need to show on the website and in case the special condition got chosen this
needs to show like it does right now.

3. Save contact requests in database and make viewable in dashboard.

I want the customers to be able to fill in the contact (Reserve) form at the bottom of the page and this needs to be saved and viewable in the dashboard.
Contact form has; 
Name (string)
How many people (number)
Date and Time
Message (Text)

4. Add opening times to database and make editable in dashboard.

I want to be able to specify the open time and close time for each day of the week and this to show in a list on the website as follows:
Monday 00:00 - 00:00
Tuesday 00:00 - 00:00
Wednesday 00:00 - 00:00
Thursday 00:00 - 00:00
Friday 00:00 - 00:00
Saturday 00:00 - 00:00
Sunday 00:00 - 00:00

With the times that I filled in in the dashboard.
